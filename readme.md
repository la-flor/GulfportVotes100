# Getting Started:  
- **createdb gulfport_votes** for server to be able to be run with database (to be utilized later)
- while in venv: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- start flask server (while in /server directory):
    - *. venv/bin/activate*
    - *flask run*
- then also initialize, install, and run client side (while in /client):
    - *npm init -y*
    - *npm install*
    - *npm start*
- two servers will be running at the same time and autoupdating as changes are being made
- As a side note, all computing I'm doing is on a macOS using zsh instead of bash

# Future Thoughts:
#### Implimentation of database:
- Username/password
- Admin implimentation
- Blog
- Documents page for recreation of "____ Votes 100%" in other towns/cities
